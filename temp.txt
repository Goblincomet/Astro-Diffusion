Setting 			 	Description 									  	Default

Image Settings
clip_guidance_scale	 	Controls how much the image should look like the prompt		 	1000
tv_scale			 	Controls the smoothness of the final output					150
range_scale				Controls how far out of range RGB values are allowed to be			150
sat_scale				Controls how much saturation is allowed						0
cutn					Controls how many crops to take from the image					16
cutn_batches			Accumulate CLIP gradient from multiple batches of cuts			2

Init Settings
init_scale				This enhances the effect of the init image, a good value is 1000		0
skip_steps				Controls the starting point along the diffusion timesteps			0
perlin_init				Option to start with random perlin noise						False
perlin_mode				(gray', 'color')										'mixed'

Advanced Settings
randomize_class			Controls whether the imagenet class is randomly changed each iteration	True
clip_denoised			Determines whether CLIP discriminates a noisy or denoised image		False
fuzzy_prompt			Controls whether to add multiple noisy prompts to the prompt losses	False
rand_mag				Controls the magnitude of the random noise					0.1
use_vertical_symmetry		Enforce symmetry over x axis of the image on
					[`tr_st`*`steps` for `tr_st` in `transformation_steps`]			False
					steps of the diffusion process
use_horizontal_symmetry		Enforce symmetry over y axis of the image on
					[`tr_st`*`steps` for `tr_st` in `transformation_steps`]			False
					steps of the diffusion process
transformation_steps		Steps (expressed in percentages) in which the symmetry is enforced	[0.01]

Video Settings
video_init_flow_warp		Flow warp enabled										True
video_init_flow_blend		0 - you get raw input, 1 - you get warped diffused previous frame		0.999
video_init_check_consistency	TBD check forward-backward flow consistency
					(uncheck unless there are too many warping artifacts)				False
